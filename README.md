RGB colors are represented as triplets of numbers in the range of 0-255, representing the red, green and blue components of the resulting color. 

Each RGB color has a corresponding hexadecimal value, which is expressed as a six-digit combination of numbers and letters and starts with the # sign. The numbers and letters in a hex value can be in the range [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F]. 

The hexadecimal is basically a base 16 representation of the RGB value, which is a base 10 value. 

Write a program that takes an RGB color value as input and converts it to its Hexadecimal equivalent. 

For Example: 

Input: (66, 134, 244) 

Hex equivalent: #4286f4 

Input: (119, 119, 119) 

Hex equivalent: #777777 or #777
